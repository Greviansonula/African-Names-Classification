# Kenyan Name Classification

## Introduction
In Kenya, naming conventions vary greatly among the different tribes. Each tribe has its own unique set of rules and traditions when it comes to naming their children. One of the key factors that sets apart the naming conventions of each tribe is the structure and pattern of the names.

## Naming Conventions by Tribe

### Luhya Tribe
- Names usually consist of a Christian name, a Traditional name, and a Family name (usually the father's name).
- The personal or traditional name is usually given based on the circumstances surrounding the birth of the child, such as the time of day, the weather, or the circumstances of the birth.
- This naming convention creates a distinct structure in Luhya names, which can be used to identify an individual's tribe with a high degree of accuracy.

### Kikuyu Tribe
- Unique naming convention that includes a personal name, a father's name, and a mother's name.

## Cultural and Historical Context
- Understanding the cultural and historical context of the naming conventions is crucial for developing a model that can accurately classify Kenyan names into their corresponding tribes and genders.
- However, the dataset used in this project is limited in its context and therefore only provides the Traditional names and the tribe.

## Conclusion
- Overall, the naming conventions in Kenya's tribes follow a certain pattern and structure, which can be utilized for developing accurate models for classifying Kenyan names into tribes and genders.
- This knowledge can provide valuable information for a wide range of applications and services, and can help to improve the overall user experience.
